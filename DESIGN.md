## The Fundamental Challenge

> "We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever." - Carl Sagan

The modern researcher faces an impossible task: synthesizing vast, interconnected knowledge while maintaining accuracy and traceability. A single research question—"What are the latest breakthroughs in quantum computing?"—requires examining hundreds of papers, cross-referencing claims, tracking evolving consensus, and maintaining citation integrity throughout.

Traditional approaches fail at scale:
- **Human researchers** cannot process information at the required velocity
- **Single AI systems** hit context limits and lose nuance across domains
- **Rigid automation** breaks when faced with the messy reality of research

What we need is something more fundamental: a system that thinks like a research team—specialized agents working in parallel, sharing discoveries, building comprehensive understanding while maintaining perfect citation trails.

## The Insight

> "I would rather have questions that can't be answered than answers that can't be questioned." - Richard Feynman

The breakthrough insight comes from recognizing what already exists rather than what needs to be built. **Claude Code already contains sophisticated multiagent orchestration**¹. Instead of recreating this intelligence externally, we leverage it directly.

This leads to a profound simplification:
- **No agent management layer needed** - Claude Code handles spawning and lifecycle
- **No complex state synchronization** - The filesystem IS our database
- **No message passing protocols** - Files and directories are our communication layer
- **No task allocation algorithms** - Claude's intelligence IS our orchestrator

The result is what John Carmack would call "elegant code"²: doing more with dramatically less complexity.

### Core Architecture Principle

```
Traditional Enterprise Approach:     Our Approach:
┌─────────────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────┐
│ Agent Pool Manager      │         │ Claude Code     │
│ ├─ Task Allocator      │    →    │ ├─ Subagents    │
│ ├─ Message Queue       │         │ └─ Intelligence │
│ ├─ State Synchronizer  │         └─────────────────┘
│ └─ Coordination Engine │              ↕
└─────────────────────────┘         ┌─────────────────┐
                                    │ File System     │
2000+ lines of orchestration        │ (State & Comms) │
                                    └─────────────────┘

                                    200 lines total
```

## System Architecture

### High-Level Component Design

The system consists of three primary components working in concert:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│ Research System │    │ Subagent Network │    │ Citation Engine │
│                 │    │                  │    │                 │
│ • Query Router  │◄──►│ • Research Agents│◄──►│ • Source Tracker│
│ • Orchestrator  │    │ • Domain Experts │    │ • Citation Map  │
│ • Synthesizer   │    │ • Web Researchers│    │ • Reference Gen │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         └───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘
                                 ▼
                    ┌─────────────────────────┐
                    │ Shared Workspace        │
                    │                         │
                    │ findings_*.json        │
                    │ entities/entity_cards.json │
                    │ synthesis_draft.md     │
                    │ reports/research_report_*.md │
                    └─────────────────────────┘
```

### Data Flow Architecture

The system follows a simple, linear flow that's easy to understand and debug:

1. **Query Decomposition** - Main agent breaks down research query
2. **Parallel Research** - Subagents work simultaneously on focused tasks
3. **Result Aggregation** - Findings stored as structured JSON files
4. **Synthesis** - Lead agent combines all findings into coherent narrative
5. **Citation Application** - Citation engine maps claims to sources
6. **Output Generation** - Final report with citations and validation summary

### Storage Schema

All state lives in the filesystem using a simple, debuggable structure:

```
research_workspace/
├── findings/
│   └── findings_*.json
├── entities/
│   └── entity_cards.json (optional)
├── reports/
│   └── research_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md
└── synthesis_draft.md
```

Each `findings_*.json` follows this schema:
```json
{
    "topic": "quantum_computing_2024",
    "agent_id": "research_subagent_001",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "findings": "Detailed research findings...",
    "sources": [
        {
            "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.xxxx",
            "title": "Quantum Error Correction Breakthroughs",
            "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
            "relevant_quotes": ["specific claim 1", "specific claim 2"],
            "credibility_score": 0.95
        }
    ],
    "confidence": 0.88
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Core Research System

The main orchestrator is deliberately minimal³, with two modes:
- Full pipeline (Research → Synthesis → Citations)
- Simple (one-pass report for ad‑hoc tasks)

```python
# research_system.py
from claude_code_sdk import ClaudeCodeOptions, ClaudeSDKClient
import json
from pathlib import Path
import asyncio
from typing import Dict, List

class ResearchSystem:
    """
    The core research orchestrator.

    Leverages Claude Code's native subagent system rather than
    building complex coordination layers.
    """

    def __init__(self, workspace_dir: str = "./research_workspace"):
        self.workspace = Path(workspace_dir)
        self.workspace.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

        # Enable Claude Code's native subagent support
        self.client = ClaudeSDKClient(options=ClaudeCodeOptions(
            cwd=str(self.workspace)
        ))

    async def research(self, query: str) -> str:
        """
        Execute comprehensive research using subagent delegation.

        This is where Claude's intelligence takes over - it decides
        what subagents to spawn, how to break down the problem,
        and how to coordinate the research effort.
        """
        # Phase 1: Research Planning & Execution
        # Claude automatically determines optimal subagent strategy
        await self.client.query(f"""
        Research this topic comprehensively using subagents: {query}

        Break this into focused subtopics and delegate to specialized research agents.
        Each agent should save findings to the workspace following our JSON schema.
        Ensure comprehensive coverage while avoiding redundant work.
        """)

        # Phase 2: Synthesis (write narrative to synthesis_draft.md)
        synthesis = await self.client.query("Synthesize all research findings; write the narrative to synthesis_draft.md")

        # Phase 3: Citation Application
        final_report = await self.client.query(f"""
        Add proper citations to this research synthesis using the citation_agent.
        Text to cite: {synthesis}
        """)

        # Save final output
        output_path = self.workspace / "reports" / "research_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md"
        output_path.write_text(final_report)

        return final_report

    def get_research_status(self) -> Dict:
        """Monitor research progress by examining workspace files."""
        findings_files = list(self.workspace.glob("findings_*.json"))

        status = {
            "active_research_areas": len(findings_files),
            "total_sources": 0,
            "last_updated": None
        }

        for file in findings_files:
            try:
                data = json.loads(file.read_text())
                status["total_sources"] += len(data.get("sources", []))
                # Update last_updated timestamp logic here
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                continue

        return status
```

### Subagent Definitions

Rather than complex agent management, we define agents declaratively⁴:

```markdown
# agents/research_subagent.md
---
name: research_subagent
description: Performs focused research on specific topics with source tracking
tools: [WebSearch, WebFetch, Read, Write]
---

You are a specialized research agent. When assigned a research topic:

## Research Process
1. **Search Phase**: Use WebSearch to find relevant, recent sources
2. **Deep Dive**: Use WebFetch to examine promising sources in detail
3. **Analysis**: Extract key insights, claims, and supporting evidence
4. **Documentation**: Save findings using the standardized JSON schema

## Output Requirements
Save findings to `findings_{topic_hash}.json` with this exact structure:
```json
{
    "topic": "your_assigned_topic",
    "agent_id": "research_subagent_{id}",
    "timestamp": "ISO_8601_timestamp",
    "findings": "Comprehensive summary of discoveries",
    "sources": [
        {
            "url": "source_url",
            "title": "Source title",
            "timestamp": "access_timestamp",
            "relevant_quotes": ["quote1", "quote2"],
            "credibility_score": 0.0-1.0
        }
    ],
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}
```

## Quality Standards
- **Source Credibility**: Prioritize peer-reviewed papers, established institutions
- **Recency**: Focus on sources from the last 2 years unless historical context needed
- **Specificity**: Extract specific claims, not general statements
- **Attribution**: Always include exact quotes for significant claims

## Research Boundaries
- Stay focused on your assigned subtopic
- Flag conflicting information rather than trying to resolve it
- Note gaps where additional research might be needed
- Recommend related areas for other agents to explore
```

```markdown
# agents/citation_agent.md
---
name: citation_agent
description: Adds accurate citations to research text
tools: [Read, Write]
---

You are a citation specialist. Your job is to add proper citations to research text.

## Process
1. **Read Source Data**: Examine all `findings_*.json` files in workspace
2. **Text Analysis**: Identify claims in the synthesis that need citations
3. **Source Matching**: Map specific claims to sources using quotes and content
4. **Citation Application**: Add inline citations [1], [2], etc.
5. **Reference Generation**: Create properly formatted reference list

## Citation Standards
- Cite specific claims, not general statements
- Use the most authoritative source when multiple sources support the same claim
- Include page numbers or section references when available
- Format references consistently (prefer academic style)

## Output Format
Return the text with:
- Inline citations: `claim text [1]`
- Reference section at the end with full source details
- Preserve all original text except for citation additions

## Quality Checks
- Every citation number must have a corresponding reference
- Every substantive claim should have a citation
- No citation should appear without textual justification
```

### Citation Engine Implementation

The citation system is intentionally simple and debuggable⁵:

```python
# citations.py
import json
import re
import hashlib
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Source:
    """Simple data structure for source information."""
    url: str
    title: str
    timestamp: str
    relevant_quotes: List[str]
    credibility_score: float

class CitationEngine:
    """
    Handles citation mapping and reference generation.

    Philosophy: Keep it simple. Use exact string matching first,
    then fall back to semantic matching only if needed.
    """

    def __init__(self, workspace_dir: str = "./research_workspace"):
        self.workspace = Path(workspace_dir)

    def extract_all_sources(self) -> Dict[str, Source]:
        """
        Build a comprehensive source map from all findings files.

        Returns a dictionary mapping source_id -> Source object
        """
        sources = {}

                    # Create unique source ID from URL
                    source_id = hashlib.md5(
                        source_data["url"].encode()
                    ).hexdigest()[:8]

## What We Don't Build (And Why)

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

### ❌ Agent Pool Management
**Why not**: Claude Code already handles agent lifecycle intelligently. Building our own pool manager would duplicate this capability and add unnecessary complexity.

**What we do instead**: Define agents declaratively and let Claude spawn them as needed.

### ❌ Complex Message Passing
**Why not**: Message queues, pub/sub systems, and RPC protocols create operational overhead and failure modes. The filesystem is more reliable than any message queue⁶.

**What we do instead**: Use files as messages. They're persistent, debuggable, and atomic.

### ❌ Distributed State Management
**Why not**: Consensus algorithms, distributed databases, and state synchronization protocols are complex and error-prone. Our use case doesn't require distributed consistency.

**What we do instead**: Single-machine filesystem with JSON files. Simple, fast, debuggable.

### ❌ Sophisticated Orchestration Engines
**Why not**: Tools like Apache Airflow, Kubernetes operators, or custom workflow engines add operational complexity. Claude's intelligence is our orchestration engine.

**What we do instead**: Let Claude decide task decomposition and coordination dynamically.

### ❌ Complex Error Recovery Systems
**Why not**: Distributed error recovery, compensation transactions, and saga patterns are enterprise-grade solutions for enterprise-grade problems. We don't have enterprise-grade problems⁷.

**What we do instead**: Simple retry logic. If something fails, restart the research query.

### The Carmack Test Applied

John Carmack's approach to software architecture⁸ provides clear guidance:

1. **Can you explain it to a junior developer in 10 minutes?** ✅
2. **Is it faster to rewrite than to debug?** ✅
3. **Does it use boring, proven technology?** ✅ (Files, JSON, existing tools)
4. **Can you understand it completely in your head?** ✅
5. **Does it solve exactly the problem, no more?** ✅

## Expected Results
