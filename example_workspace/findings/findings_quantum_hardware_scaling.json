    "findings": "Quantum hardware scaling has accelerated dramatically in 2024, with multiple companies achieving significant qubit count milestones. IBM's roadmap targets 100,000 qubits by 2033, while Google's new chip architecture demonstrates improved coherence times at scale. Atom Computing achieved a breakthrough with 1,000+ neutral atom qubits, and IonQ's trapped ion systems show promise for modular scaling approaches.",
