    "findings": "Significant breakthroughs in quantum error correction emerged in 2024, particularly in surface code implementations and logical qubit fidelity improvements. Google's quantum team achieved 99.5% fidelity with their new error correction protocols, while IBM demonstrated a 10x reduction in logical error rates. The field has seen convergence on surface codes as the most practical near-term approach, with several groups achieving below-threshold error rates for the first time.",
